# Harmony 3 Aerospace Applications for SAM RH71 Family

MPLAB® Harmony 3 is an extension of the MPLAB® ecosystem for creating
embedded firmware solutions for Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC microcontroller
and microprocessor devices.  Refer to the following links for more information.

This repository contains the MPLAB® Harmony 3 Aerospace Application examples for SAM RH71 Family. It provides
usage example of the IP1553, SpaceWire, ICM and ECC peripherals in the SAMRH71.

**Code Examples**

The following applications are provided to demonstrate the typical or interesting usage models of one or more peripheral libraries.
