# SpaceWire RMAP Loopback Example

This example shows how configure the SpaceWire peripheral to configure the RMAP module, send an RMAP command with the packet transceiver and receive the RMAP reply with the packet receiver.

**Building The Application**

The parent folder for all the MPLABX IDE projects for this application is given below:

**Application Path**: aerospace\\apps\\spw\\spw\_rmap\_loopback\\firmware

To build the application, refer to the table below and open the appropriate project file in MPLABX IDE.

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|sam\_rh71\_ek.X|SAM RH71 Evaluation Kit board|

**MPLAB Harmony Configurations**

Refer to the MHC project graph for the components used and the respective configuration options.

**Hardware Setup**

1.  Project sam\_rh71\_ek.X

    -   Hardware Used

        -   SAM RH71 Evaluation Kit

        -   SpaceWire cable

    -   Hardware Setup

        -   Connect the debugger probe to J33

        -   Connect the USB port on the board to the computer using a mini USB cable.

        -   Connect the two SpaceWire link on the board to each other using a SpaceWire cable.


**Running The Application**

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.

2.  Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None

3.  Build and Program the application using the MPLABX IDE.

4.  See the following message in the console.

    Wait for both SWP link switch to run state
        SPW Link in Run state
    Initialize packet receiver to receive 1 packet(s) of 8 bytes
    Send SWP packet with RMAP command write with reply
    Wait RMAP reply
        Receive RMAP WRITE reply : ID = 0xabcd, with status : 0x0
      RMAP write command reply with status OK
    Initialize packet receiver to receive 1 packet(s) of 80 bytes
    Send SWP packet with RMAP command read
    Wait RMAP reply
        Receive RMAP READ reply : ID = 0xabcd, with status : 0x0
          Receive 64 bytes of data :
            00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 0A, 0B, 0C, 0D, 0E, 0F,
